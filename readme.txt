Plugin makes it very easy to insert a calculator from Calculoid.com into your Wordpress website.

== Description ==

When you create some calculator from Calculoid.com or you just want to use some calculator from Calculoid library, this plugin makes it very simple to embed it into your WP content.

Plugin utilizes WordPress Shortcodes, so all you need to do is to insert this shortcode:

    [calculoid id=64]

With the **id** parameter you specify which calculator you want to display. You can use this shortcode anywhere in WordPress.

Plugin's configuration allows you to insert your API key, which you receive when you register to Calculoid.com. So if you want to embrace function of your Calculoid membership, insert your API key.

The calculator does not use iframe, so it is part of your HTML content, which is great, because it inherites your CSS styles and the calculator fit in. The same font, same color and so on.

It won't slow down your website. The calculator is loaded asynchronously after the website is loaded. 

== Installation ==

1. Install plugin the usual way.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
